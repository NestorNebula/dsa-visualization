## About

![App Screenshot](./public/images/screenshot.png)

This project is an application that allows users to visualize Data Structures and Algorithms more easily.

Users can see the representations of different data structures, interact with them as well as creating their own versions of the data structures.

In the Algorithms part, users can use their data structures (or the predefined ones) and look at a visual representation of diverse algorithms execution.

The user's data structures are saved, allowing them to continue their exploration once they return back to the app.
